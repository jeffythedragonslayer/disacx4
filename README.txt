Disacx4 - Capcom Cx4 Disassembler

The Capcom Cx4 chip is used in two games - Megaman X2 and X3 - for doing wireframe graphics.
This dissassmbler was created from research by Overload and nocash:

The Cx4 machine code is located somewhere in the Megaman ROMs.
To create the .cx4 file it expects, you can use a hex editor to truncate out everything from the ROM that isn't Cx4 machine code.

This disassembler is currently untested as I do not own any SNES Megaman carts; I would really appreciate some feedback on it.
Hopefully someone finds it useful for reverse engineering the games.
